/*
 * Find Second Smallest and Second Largest Element in an array

Problem Statement: Given an array, find the second smallest and second largest element in the array. Print ‘-1’ in the event that either of them doesn’t exist.

Example 1:
Input:
 [1,2,4,7,7,5]
Output:
 Second Smallest : 2
	Second Largest : 5
Explanation:
 The elements are as follows 1,2,3,5,7,7 and hence second largest of these is 5 and second smallest is 2

Example 2:
Input:
 [1]
Output:
 Second Smallest : -1
	Second Largest : -1
Explanation:
 Since there is only one element in the array, it is the largest and smallest element present in the array. There is no second largest or second smallest element present.
